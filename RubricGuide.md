###### Object-Oriented Design (20 points)
Clear and effective use of OOP
- [x] (10) Class Hierarchy: Clear and effective use of inheritance to establish a meaningful class hierarchy for entities like Book, User, and Transaction.
- [x] (5) Encapsulation: Appropriately encapsulate data fields and ensure critical information is accessed and modified through well-defined methods.
- [x] (5) Polymorphism: Demonstrate the implementation of polymorphic behavior, such as different transaction types using a common interface.

###### Implementation (25 points) Working correct code
Correctness , Consistency with Design , Exception Handling
- [x] (10) Consistency with Design: Implement the design faithfully, reflecting the class relationships and interactions outlined in the class diagram.
- [x] (10) Correctness: Ensure the system functions as expected, allowing users to perform actions like borrowing books, returning books, and searching the library.
- [ ] (5) Exception Handling: Effectively handle exceptions, providing meaningful error messages and ensuring the system gracefully handles unexpected scenarios.

###### Interfaces and Abstract Classes (10 points) use of Interfaces and/or Abstract Classes
Use of Interfaces/Abstract Classes
- [x] (5) Consistent Implementation: Ensure that classes implementing interfaces or extending abstract classes do so consistently and appropriately.
- [x] (5) Interfaces and/or abstract classes: Incorporate interfaces and/or abstract classes to define common behaviors, such as a Searchable interface implemented by relevant classes.

###### Persistence (15 points): Data Storage (8 points) and Data Integrity (7 points)
Data Storage and Data Integrity in place
- [x] (8) Data Storage: Implement data persistence effectively, either through a database or file system, allowing the system to save and retrieve information accurately.
- [x] (7) Data Integrity: Ensure data integrity during storage and retrieval processes, handling potential issues like data corruption or loss.

###### Testing and Test Coverage Results
Test Coverage (8 points) and Test Results (7 points)
- [x] (8) Test Coverage: Develop a comprehensive set of test cases that cover various functionalities and scenarios within the Library Management System.
- [x] (7) Test Results: Document and present the results of the testing process, demonstrating that the system functions correctly under different conditions.

###### Documentation
Design Documentation and Code Comments
- [x] (8) Design Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation explaining the design choices, class relationships, and how OOP principles are applied.
- [x] (7) Code Comments: Include meaningful comments throughout the code to enhance understanding and maintainability.
