Things we need to talk about:

###### OOP
+ Clear and effective use of OOP 
+ Clear and effective use of inheritance (Books, Users, and Transactions (10)
+ Encapsulate data fields of critical information so they are only access through getters and updated with setters (5)
+ Poly morphic behavior of different transaction types - Controller and interfaces (5)

###### Implementation/ working and correct code
- Correctness, consistency, and exception handling following our design
- Following design as well as we could (10)
- Functions as expected (user borrowBook, returnBook, *search*) (10)
- Exception handling (5)

###### Interfaces and Abstract Class
* Use of interface and abstract class <---- need to do this? (10)
* Classes implementing interfaces or extending abstract class do so appropriately and cosistently (5)
* interface or abstract class <--- declaratoin for search definition----> implemented by relevent class (5)

###### Persistence
Data persistence: SQLite (8)
Data recovery: *Ensure data integrity during storage and retrieval process* from corruption or loss (7)

###### Testing and Test Coverage Results
* Testing Plan (8)
    * White box Unit tests
    * black box end-to-end test of key functions/scenarios
* Results and demonstration it works under different conditions? (7)

###### Documentation
* Discuss (8)
    * Design Choices
    * class relationships
    * application of OOP principles
* Meaningful comments throughout the code to increase understanding and maintainability (7)
