#### Introduction:
*To design, implement, test, collaborate, and retain the learnings of a college course by providing evidence of our experience gained in a thoughtful and coherent manner through documentation and code for the beginning stage of an Adaptable Library Management System while faithfully adhering as closely to OOP principles and applying design patterns.*

#### **Design:**


#### **Implementation:**

#### **Testing:**

#### **Reflection:**


Things we need to talk about:

###### OOP
+ Clear and effective use of OOP
+ Clear and effective use of inheritance (Books, Users, and Transactions)
+ Encapsulate data fields of critical information so they are only access through getters and updated with setters
+ Poly morphic behavior of different transaction types - Controller and interfaces

###### Implementation/ working and correct code
- Correctness, consistency, and exception handling following our design
- Following design as well as we could
- Functions as expected (user borrowBook, returnBook, *search*)
- Exception handling

###### Interfaces and Abstract Class
* Use of interface and abstract class <---- need to do this?
* Classes implementing interfaces or extending abstract class do so appropriately and cosistently
* interface or abstract class <--- declaratoin for search definition----> implemented by relevent class

###### Persistence
Data persistence: SQLite
Data recovery: *Ensure data integrity during storage and retrieval process* from corruption or loss

###### Testing and Test Coverage Results
* Testing
    * White box Unit tests
    * black box end to end test of key functions/scenarios
* Results and demonstration it works under different conditions?

###### Documentation
* Discuss
    * Design Choices
    * class relationships
    * application of OOP principles
* Meaningful comments throughout the code to increase understanding and maintainability
